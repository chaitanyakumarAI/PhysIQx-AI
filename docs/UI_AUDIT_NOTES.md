# PhysIQx AI — Full Application Audit & Improvement Notes
*Audited live on `http://localhost:3000` · 2026-07-19*

## 🌟 Executive Summary

A full end-to-end traversal of all 34+ routes, interactive components, settings, catalog filters, and wizard flows was conducted on the running local development server. 

The application is highly responsive, theme-consistent (sleek dark mode `#0a0d0b`), and error-free in the browser console. All data visualizations (Radar Chart, Recharts trend line, PR scrubbers, Heatmap) render without layout shifts.

## 🔍 Detailed Route-by-Route Breakdown

### 1. Home Dashboard (`/home`)
* **Verified:**
  * Daily mission card ("Push-Heavy", +320 XP, 52 min) links directly to `/session/mission-push-a`.
  * Guided onboarding walkthrough (`?tour=1`) functions smoothly across 10 interactive highlight steps.
  * Today's Priorities (`20-min zone-2 walk` and `Weekly weigh-in`) correctly route to Cardio Logging and Body Stats respectively.
* **Improvements Identified:**
  * **Tour Replay Link:** On `/profile`, the "Replay app tour" button is currently overlapped when an active session banner is present.

---

### 2. Training Hub (`/train`)
* **Verified:**
  * Program switcher (PPL, Upper-Lower, Arnold, etc.) allows variant toggling (e.g. 6 days vs. 5 days/week) cleanly.
  * Cardio logger (`/train/cardio`) correctly updates recent cardio sessions in local storage.
  * Exercise Catalog (`/train/exercises/[id]`) supports instant search filter and muscle group chips (e.g. "Legs", "Chest").
* **Improvements Identified:**
  * **Program Card Tap Area:** Currently, clicking "View program" opens the program. Wrapping the **entire card container** in the click target will improve mobile ergonomics.
  * **Plan Builder Validation Helper (`/train/plans/new`):** The "Save plan" button disables when a day is empty, but lacks explicit helper text explaining *why* it's disabled. Adding `hint: "Add at least 1 exercise per day to save"` resolves user confusion.

---

### 3. Insights Engine (`/insights`)
* **Verified:**
  * Range filters (`7D`, `30D`, `90D`, `1Y`) dynamically recalculate chart axes.
  * Personal Record (PR) switcher updates max weight & historic progression graph instantly.
  * Coach AI card respects the ≤ 2-sentence length contract cleanly.
* **Improvements Identified:**
  * **Empty PR State:** Adding a subtle "No PR recorded yet for this exercise" ghost state for unlogged custom exercises.

---

### 4. Compete & Community (`/compete`)
* **Verified:**
  * Leaderboard tabs (`Weekly`, `Monthly`, `All-time`) transition smoothly.
  * Streak status card and XP badge system render as expected.
* **Improvements Identified:**
  * **Friend Challenge Actions:** "Challenge Friend" button currently shows coming-soon Toast; adding a mock challenge modal enhances Phase 2 feel.

---

### 5. Profile & Settings (`/profile`)
* **Verified:**
  * Avatar picker (`/profile/settings/avatar`) updates global user avatar immediately.
  * Body Stats (`/profile/body`) weight logger correctly updates `profileStore`.
  * Notifications settings toggle switches persist state.
* **Improvements Identified:**
  * **Floating Session Banner Layering:** When a workout session is active, the `ResumeSessionBanner` floats at the bottom and covers the lower profile settings buttons. Adding extra bottom padding (`pb-32`) to the profile container prevents visual overlap.

## 🛠️ High-Value Recommended Fixes

| Priority | Feature / Area | Action Required |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 High | **Layout Z-Index / Padding** | Add `pb-32` bottom padding to `/profile` and `/train/plans/new` so floating active session banner doesn't cover action buttons. |
| 🟡 Medium | **Plan Builder Helper** | Add explicit helper text near "Save plan" when validation requirements aren't met. |
| 🟡 Medium | **Full Card Tap Area** | Wrap Program Cards on `/train` in full clickable tap targets. |
| 🟢 Low | **Empty PR State** | Add zero-state fallback illustration for exercises without logged PRs. |
